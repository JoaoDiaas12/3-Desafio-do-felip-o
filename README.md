    <strong>ðŸ“šCode Features:</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">

Class and Objects (Object-Oriented Programming):

A `hero` class was created, and an object (instance) of this class was initialized with attributes (type, attack, name, age).
Constructor:

The class uses a constructor method to initialize the attributes when creating a new instance.
Write Method:

Implements logic to display information about the object. It uses:
- Template literals (backticks, `${}`).
- String concatenation (`+` operator).
- Data interpolation and display (`console.log`):

Uses `console.log` to format and display messages including the object's attribute values.
Instantiation (`new`):

An object `saida` is created from the `hero` class.
